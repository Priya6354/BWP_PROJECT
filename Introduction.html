              As far back as the year 183d, it was realised that municipal work was necessary within the city walls, and
              it was ordered that the four principal roads should be regularly watered by a newly created municipal
              agency. The cost was to be met by the levy of a cess from the keepers of the shops. This cess was
              collected but for a short times, though the work of watering the roads continued and the expenses were
              borne by the their Baroda state Govt., the responsibility of repairing the existing roads and making new
              ones was recognised and to defray the cost it was decided to levy dues on certain articles imported and
              exported. In 1869 and attempt was made to carry on municipal administration through a small committee
              consisting of different interests. The committee. Consisted of five members and was presided over by a
              Sudharai Kamdar or Municipal Commissioner, all nominated by the Baroda State Gov. A house tax was
              introduced and was assessed at Rs.2-8-0 per thousand of the house value, but the tax was soon dropped.

            <p class="P-content">
              In the year 1872, a Kalambandi was sanctioned empowering the municipality to add to its funds by levying
              Nazarundas, license fees on new buildings, rents on enclosures of a temporary nature erected on marriage
              ceremonies and rental for Govt. land occupied for private purposes. In the same year it was recognised
              that the task for arranging for sweepers for public needs within the city belonged to the municipality.

              The municipal Act of 1905 not only conferred financial independence on the municipality adding to its
              importance, as well as responsibilities, duties and powers, but also to a large extent separated the
              administrative functions from the purely executive. The Municipal Commissioner at once created to be the
              servant and master of the municipality. The new Act specifically laid down that no stipendiary servant of
              the municipality can hold office as a councillor, much less as its president. The Suba of the

              The Act of 1905 was based chiefly upon the Bombay District Municipal Act as amended in 1901, altered where
              necessary to suit local conditions and circumstances. It provided for a Municipal Board consisting of 37
              members of whom 25 were elected by the people triennially, 6 were nominated by the Govt. and 6 were
              ex-officio members of the municipality. The whole municipal administration vested in the corporation,
              which was in the last instance, responsible to the Govt. for its efficient management of municipal
              affairs.

              Prior to 1877, there were no municipalities in the districts. In that year however municipalities were
              established in most of the Taluka places, though they had no definite constitutions nor was any financial
              provision made for thews. They were entirely managed by the administrations of the Talukas. There was no
              house tax nor was there any general assessment of property. Baroda State Govt. had under taken to defray
              all the expenses by regular annual grants which were in the beginning placed under the control of the
              public works Dept. and subsequently in 1892, under the management of the Sanitory Commissioner. Later, the
              subas were authorised to prepare lists of individuals likely to take an intelligent interest in local
              affairs and to appoint from 8 to 16 members to carry on the municipal administration in different places.
